## About

The Solana ecosystem has a fragmented and very customized way of storing in-game assets on chain, with as many different formats as there are play-2-earn games. However, the methods of storing ordinary NFT data are standardized in the Metaplex Protocol. The aim of Raindrops is to do the same thing for game assets.
